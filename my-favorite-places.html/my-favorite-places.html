    <h1>My Favorite Places!</h1>
    <h2>Written with the guidence of Epicodus!</h2>

    <p>As a true Oregonian, I love me some outdoors!</p>
    <p> I spend a lot of time by the water, wether that be by the river,
       or the ocean. My favorite place to visit is the beautiful Oregon 
       coast. Specifically Oswald west State Park. It is absolutely 
       gorgeous, Its got a bunch of trails, 2 creeks, tide pooling, 
       surf access, and a waterfall!</p>
